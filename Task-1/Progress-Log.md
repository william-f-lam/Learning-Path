- After visiting the PeMS website, I've decided to choose the Playwright library for my task of webscraping thanks to it's accessibility and ease of use for dynamic websites like the PeMS dataset.
  - Documentation can be found here: https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library
- I've succesfully automated log-in to the PeMS website and plan on fully automating the workflow from ID collection to data storage.
