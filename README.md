**Task 1: Automate the Collection of PeMS Truck Flow Data**
**Task Description:**
- Collect sensor information from the PeMS system within the SCAQMD jurisdiction.
- Develop an automated pipeline to download traffic flow data from hundreds of PeMS sensors, capturing hourly traffic volumes for both passenger cars and trucks.
- Analyze traffic patterns and develop a method to visualize traffic flow on roadways.
- Create a visually appealing GitHub repository to showcase traffic flow, enhancing visibility in the field.
- Literature review on traffic flow prediction models; Develop a machine-learning model to predict traffic flows (both passenger cars and trucks).

**Task Purpose:**
- Gain hands-on experience working with real-world transportation datasets. 
- Strengthen skills in data engineering, automation, visualization, and optionally, predictive modeling and AI in the context of traffic systems.
