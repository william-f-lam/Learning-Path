**Task 1: Automate the Collection of PeMS Truck Flow Data**  
Purpose:
- Develop a Python script to automatically collect publically available data from the California Performance Measurement (PeMS) Data Source, specifically truck flow along I5-N, District 7 Stations.
- Gain hands-on experience working with real-world transportation datasets. 
- Strengthen skills in data engineering, automation, visualization, and optionally, predictive modeling and AI in the context of traffic systems.
  
**Task 5: Data-Driven Prediction of Next Stops in Truck Tours**  
Purpose:
- Develop a statistical or machine learning (ML) model that, given an OD (origin-destination) pair as input, predicts a probability distribution over the top five most likely next destinations after arriving at the input destination.
- Apply both descriptive statistics and predictive ML modeling to transportation logistics.
- Build a flexible and reusable function that could later be embedded into a larger transportation simulation system.
